# Shader-Graph-Unity  
Shader Graph lets you easily author shaders by building them visually and see the results in real-time. You create and connect nodes in a network graph instead of having to write code.  
This project is a tutorial to make a shader graph example. 
I made a Shader graph which gives the effect of a hologram adding also many other cool effects like fresnel effect.  
I made this effect on a Dragon with animation.
